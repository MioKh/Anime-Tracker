# Anime-Tracker
A web app that allow you to keep track of the anime's you watched , currently watching , and planing to watch just to keep track and show you how many animes you know


So to be honest I have no Idea currently how to approach this I have a rough idea on how to make the tracking system like a array and a object constructer but other then that I have no idea :D. I'll just try to figure it out
