# Anime-Tracker
A web application that allows you to keep track of the anime you have watched, are currently watching, and plan to watch. It helps you organize and monitor your anime collection, providing insights into the number of anime series you are familiar with.

Honestly, I'm currently unsure about the approach to develop this application. I have a rough idea of using an array and an object constructor for the tracking system, but beyond that, I still need to figure it out.

The main functionality seems relatively manageable, involving converting an array of objects into HTML elements and iterating through them. Additionally, I need to create a modal add button, which I could potentially implement using a constructor. I'll see how things progress and adjust accordingly. For now, this should be sufficient.


Ok so I  made the simple functionality  now I need to create the modal and figure out how to make a object contsructer that takes the inputs from a a form inside the modal that shows when you press a button 



Soo I think it does work fairly enough for now and this is okay for me even if its not that pretty or amazing looking it works and that is what is important 
I might add a iamge adding later its not that hard but I need to change the layout of the cards to make them look good so for now i'll stick with just text 
I will now continue with the rest of the course
